1PUL;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvV03UxqIOk;"1PUL (1st Place You Look, pronounced ""one pull"") is a Flutter web app (prototype) that inventories items moved by people, and has an interface to search the inventory. In an environment with many items and lots of storage options (like a busy household or an office), it can be challenging to 1) track down the last place an item was seen, and 2) have all the items in mind when trying to solve a problem or fulfill a list. 1PUL can also be used to actively inventory a collection of items.
When the Flutter code detects movement from the camera by comparing frames, it hits the Gemini API with a camera frame and a prompt like, ""if there's a person holding an object, and the object is clearly visible, describe the object"". Gemini's object description, plus the still image url, camera location, and (optionally) transcribed audible comments from the person, are written to a Google Sheet. The still image is uploaded to a GCS bucket. The capturing device running 1PUL will also briefly show that an item is being inventoried.
Inventory Search is a feature that sends a user query (ex: ""what camping gear do I have"", ""where's my socket wrench"") to the Gemini API, along with the full inventory descriptions (thanks for the giant context window!), with a prompt like, ""match this user query to the most relevant item descriptions"". There's some prompting to get structured output, which the dart code maps back to inventory items to present to the user.";Flutter, Web/Chrome, Sheets API, Cloud Storage API;Brian Herbert;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/1pul

3D Plant Facility Simulator;3D simulator with AI chatbot for interactive technical education.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFMl0bGCGFs;"The 3D Plant Facility Simulator is an educational application designed to immerse students in a virtual industrial environment from day one of their training. Built in PlayCanvas, the app allows users to navigate a fully interactive 3D plant facility, featuring hydraulic pumps, electric motors, a mixer, an electric cabin, and various valves. A central guide mark helps users explore the facility by highlighting key objects and suggesting questions to ask the integrated AI-driven chatbot.

The chatbot is a critical feature of the app, offering real-time, contextually relevant answers to technical questions about the plant's components. To achieve this, we utilized the Gemini API to create high-quality embeddings from a carefully curated knowledge base. When a user poses a question, it is sent from PlayCanvas to a Python server hosted on PythonAnywhere via Flask. The server then processes the question using the Gemini API to generate embeddings, which are stored and managed in Pineconeƒ??s vector storage. These embeddings are crucial in helping the chatbot understand and retrieve the most relevant information. Finally, using Langchain, the app generates accurate and educational responses tailored to the userƒ??s query.

This innovative approach helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, making it easier for instructors to teach and for students to learn complex industrial concepts in a more engaging and interactive way.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;š?bung;Brazil;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/3d-plant-facility-simulator

Agrum.ai;The app that analyzes your meal to improve your daily life and health.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDVPqlq2q-A;"Agrum.ai is an app with the ambitious goal to help people improve their diet and the quality of what they eat based on the analysis of their meals. Our purpose is to make it easy to achieve by using artificial intelligence to both enhance user experience and the results. First, the app asks you to take a full picture of your dish (one picture is required per dish). The picture is then analyzed by Gemini. Quantities, meal's name, meal's ingredients are automatically determined by Gemini. Then multiple databases are used to retrieve nutritional information based on Gemini's findings. Gemini is once again involved in the matching process. Once the results are available, they are displayed to the user who then has the ability to adjust the quantities for better results. In addition, and in an effort to raise awareness about environment, the results also display an estimated carbon and water footprint for the meal.
Once satisfied, the user can save the meal to their history. In their history, users have access to charts to follow their calories intake per day, nutrients and their evolution day after day. The goal here is to provide people who have a global objective (loose weight, specific nutrients intake...) the means to do so.

AI Shift;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPdlY0l1XNg;"AI Shift is a web app that automates and optimizes shift scheduling. Simply input your complex workplace rules, and it will generate shifts that meet both employee preferences and operational needs, considering factors like interpersonal relationships and individual circumstances that traditional methods often struggle to handle.

Shift creation has long been a complex challenge in workforce management. Traditional mathematical optimization methods simply allocate staff numbers to meet basic requirements. However, they cannot handle complex workplace constraints like interpersonal factors, individual preferences, or nuanced company policies.
Moreover, relying solely on generative AI for shift creation also presents challenges. While AI excels at understanding shift rules, it struggles with aggregating data and performing the type of mathematical optimizations that traditional methods handle well.

To address these limitations, we've implemented a hybrid Chain-of-Thought method, where non-AI code performs the statistical analysis that AI typically struggles with, and feeds this aggregated data back to the AI. AI Shift overcomes these limitations through this hybrid approach that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with specialized non-AI algorithms.

AI Shift uses Gemini in 3 steps:
1. Generate initial shifts from user input.
2. Refine shifts by adding statistical analysis data by non-AI algorithm.
3. Validate shifts against workplace rules.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;ams.jp;Japan;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/ai-shift

ASD Support;Gemini provides help & monitoring to individuals with Autism at home.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDHEszdBPU8;"The app allows users to converse with Gemini as if they were in an Applied Behavioural Therapy session for individuals with autism to improve their social skills and be monitored for repetitive/harmful behaviours. The topics of conversation and behaviours exhibited are stored to later be reviewed by friends, family, or therapists to guide the individualƒ??s treatment plans. Since therapy sessions tend to be expensive and infrequent, this application could help struggling families support family members with autism.
The conversational format is achieved thanks to Geminiƒ??s unique ability to evaluate both visual and audio data. During the conversation, image frames and audio files are uploaded to the Gemini API. Gemini evaluates the frames and audio together, allowing Gemini to evaluate and respond to physical and auditory actions of the individual such as facial expressions, vocal inflections, pronunciation, and more. For example, Gemini can make note of a harmful behaviour (hitting oneself) and also for how many frames it occurred for. Over time, progress can be evaluated by how much a behaviour is reduced, measured by having the behaviour occur over less frames (time).
On Firebase, the chat transcripts and noted behaviours are stored for each session. Upon request, the session data can be provided to Gemini to summarize for parents or therapists.

AskMeOut!;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw-VksVeUs4;"AskMeOut! is an innovative online dating coach and skill builder app that leverages the power of AI to revolutionize the online dating experience. Users engage in simulated conversations with AI-generated ""dates"" tailored to their preferences to practice and build their social skills and confidence, and then receive feedback on how to improve.

At the core of AskMeOut! is the integration of the Gemini API. When a user interacts with their AI date, each message is stored in a Firestore database. This triggers a Firebase function that sends the conversation history to the Gemini API along with specific prompts. Gemini then generates a realistic and engaging response, which is subsequently added to the personalized conversation.

After at least 25 back and forth messages, the user can ask for feedback. At that point we send the entire conversation via the Gemini API with a prompt asking Gemini AI to create feedback for the user. The user receives three things they did well and three things they could improve, plus an overall summary of how well their conversation went. The user then has the option to start again with a different date persona.

By providing practice in a safe environment and then personalized feedback and guidance, AskMeOut! empowers users to build confidence, improve communication and social skills, and increase their chances of finding genuine connections. This can lead to increased self-esteem, improved relationships, and ultimately, greater happiness.";Flutter, Android, Web/Chrome, Firebase;AskMeOut!;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/askmeout

Automated Image-Based Measurement Tool;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyhzJzUJOvQ;"Transistors are essential components in integrated circuits, where their performance depends on their structure and material composition. Recently, conventional silicon-based CMOS logic devices have encountered technical and physical limitations. Consequently, many research teams are exploring new semiconductor materials to advance the field.
Our project aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to assess the quality of channel samples obtained during the exfoliation step, which is critical in the fabrication process of semiconductor devices based on novel materials. Traditionally, these channel samples are observed under an optical microscope or Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and their width is measured manually using scientific image measurement software.
However, we have designed a website that utilizes the Gemini API and image processing techniques to automate this process. Users can upload target photos to the API and immediately receive information about the width of the channels and the suitability of the samples for device fabrication. Plus, We also created and trained our own datasets for segmentation models based on the UNet architecture.

Bot or Not 2;A reverse-Turing-test / odd man out based game;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx8NIXUkEHM;"Imagine a world where the line between human and artificial intelligence blurs, making perception the ultimate challenge. Welcome to Bot or Not, a revolutionary game inspired by the Turing test. Unlike traditional tests aimed at identifying robots among humans, Bot or Not challenges players to blend in as a human imposter among AI-controlled robots.

In Bot or Not, players navigate a series of tense rounds populated by ""robots."" However, one of these robots is actually a human imposter. The objective is clear: blend in seamlessly or risk exposure and elimination.

Each round unfolds in stages of gripping interaction. Participants engage in a conversation stage where moral questions probe ethics and reasoning, setting the stage for subtle deception and strategy.

As tension mounts, the voting phase begins. Every ""robot"" casts a ballot, aiming to identify the human imposter. With each elimination, the stakes rise, hinging on the playerƒ??s ability to evade detection and outwit the AI.

Victory in Bot or Not is a testament to adaptability. The player triumphs by standing among the last two robots. Defeat is humbling for those who fail to convincingly integrate into the robotic facade and fall victim to collective scrutiny.

Bot or Not offers a compelling mix of psychological challenge and strategic gameplay. Are you ready to face the mind games? Step into a world, where every word and action could mean the difference between elimination or survival.";;Bot or Not;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/bot-or-not-2

ChainATM;Use natural language to buy crypto instantly for the first time ever.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMYgoUKvL3I;"ChainATM is an A.I. model that fulfills buy orders on chain with the help of Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Chainlink Functions and the PayPal SDK. A smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, ready to be triggered after the fiat payment is done with PayPal. Chainlink basically brings the internet into a smart contract which normally work in kind of silos by allowing API Requests to any source outside. For the first time ever, you can buy USDC with a simple text message. It takes about 90 seconds to confirm two transactions on chain until the money is released from the contract to the given recipient address.

The main use-case of the Gemini API was to create a buddy-like persona with restrictions on how to behave. We figured out that structured prompts work much better instead of freeform prompts. The model uses a given context (crypto transaction expert specializing in fiat to crypto conversions), behavior (soft-skills: friendly, talking like a long-known friend) and has two main tasks to accomplish. 1 - Extract user input and 2 - check the given recipient address for correctness. Correctness means that the given address starts with '0x' followed by 40 characters. The model will also be a consultant to help the normie user from web2 to onboard as smooth as possible by making recommendations regarding wallets.";Web/Chrome;Abi;Germany;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/chainatm

Chariot - AI Chess Analysis;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pEr0FWdfUs;"A common practice in chess is to analyze your games. This helps you learn from your mistakes, but also understand the logic behind strong moves. The app takes a standard chess game format, called a PGN, which records every move of a player's game. It then analyzes every move of the game using a computer chess engine, and assigns a rating to each move (good, bad, etc.).

This is a very standard approach to learning from your games, but it can be difficult, especially for beginner/intermediate players, to interpret an engine score and translate it into an actionable lesson. Gemini is used to help explain moves like a coach would for their students. This is done by supplying Gemini with a prompt of an image of the position, the moves that lead to this position, the engine analysis, and other contextual information.

In addition, there is a feature that allows you to play against Gemini. Because Gemini tends to hallucinate illegal moves, Gemini does not freely pick the moves with no context. It is fed the moves that have been played up to this point, and then is given a list of moves to select from an engine designed to play like a human player. As it plays moves it also engages in playful banter.";Flutter, Android, Firebase, Google cloud (cloud run);Chariot;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/chariot-ai-chess-analysis

Players start by answering quirky questions, generating a pool of unique words and phrases. These phrases are mixed into random sets, which are randomly assigned to a player. You are then given a goal for your bot to complete, and each player must use their set of words to craft imaginative chatbot prompts to have their chatbot take on the challenge given.

In every round, the player's custom chatbots engage with a CPU character to achieve the specified goal. Your bot is embodied by an avatar that you select at the beginning of the game. The avatars in the experience have AI voices, and their animations are controlled by AI as well. Animations are dynamically chosen based on the context of a given chatbot's response, powered by Gemini Flash. After the chatbots showcase their prowess, it's voting time! Players vote for the most entertaining and clever responses, turning every game into a lively debate. Points are awarded based on votes, and the first to reach 10 points wins.

We attempted to rethink what a party game could be with AI at its core. Additionally, all of the prompt-building questions we ask the users and the scenarios the chatbots must go through were generated using Google Gemini.

DataGenie 1;Simplifying Database Queries with AI;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBICCeXwMCg;"DataGenie is an innovative app designed to simplify the way users interact with databases. The app allows users to input queries in plain English, which are then translated into SQL queries, making database interaction accessible even to those without SQL knowledge. This functionality is powered by Googleƒ??s Gemini API, which handles the natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

How it works:
Users enter a query in natural language, such as ƒ??Show all customers who made a purchase last month.ƒ?? The app sends this input to the Gemini API, which processes the text and converts it into an accurate SQL query. The backend, built with Flask, then executes this query against a SQLite database, retrieving the requested data. The results are displayed to the user in a clean, user-friendly interface created with Flutter.

Gemini API Integration:
We utilized the Gemini API to handle the NLP aspects, ensuring that even complex queries are correctly interpreted and converted into SQL.

Deprompto;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC-XYYY-8o0;"Deprompto is an AI image interpretation game submitted by Jia Jie Chen to the Google Gemini API Developer Competition.

Instructions:

Deprompto is an AI image interpretation game where Google Gemini is prompted by a thematic concept, the LLM generates a list of keywords, and the player tries to get the LLM to describe the player's drawing with inclusive keywords while avoiding exclusive keywords.

A canvas, a color palette, and a radius slider are available to assist with creating the player's drawing.

If the LLM uses an inclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player gains 1 point every time the description mentions the inclusive keyword or its plural.

If the LLM uses an exclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player loses 1 point every time the description mentions the exclusive keyword or its plural.

If time limits are enabled, the player will only get a prespecified amount of time per round to draw, so prioritize accordingly.

Note: Because API calls are used in this game, a stable fast Internet connection is required.

- Check if the username chosen at registration time is racist, homophobic, harmful or negative in some way
- Invent a story, obviously before the game starts, in order to make UX interesting and let the user be part of the game by mentioning him/her into the story itself
- Generate some objects during the game that will let you gain or lose some points or time, given the game level you choose

EAGLE AI;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtH7v8m2W7g;"After using popular security systems like Ring, we noticed a large amount of false positive notifications. Eventually, many of us became desensitized to these imprecise alerts, making it hard to determine if the warning was for an actual emergency or for something as minor as a stray animal. Receiving notifications such as ""There Is Motion Detected at Your Front Door"" doesn't provide enough details. This is a huge problem, especially in home security, where every second counts.

We enhance security systems by leveraging Gemini to provide immediate, actionable security reports through text messages. Our system, EAGLE (Enhanced Automated Guardian for Living Environments) AI, reduces false positive notifications and provides detailed summaries of any detected irregularities. We have two versions of this project: one where you can access a Google Nest camera feed using the Device Access API, and another where you can use your own computer webcam through a Streamlit app for demonstration.

Features:
- Detailed summary of irregularities instead of generic notifications.
- Estimates severity and provides options for next steps.
- Applications in a variety of surveillance settings, including at home, stores, events, or any other environment where a security monitor would be needed.

- you add a new task or upload a picture of the activity. For example, you created a compost, or took a bicycle instead of car to work or planted a few trees.
- we prompt gemini to ask further clarifying questions if required. These questions are quantifiable (either numerical or enum responses).
- we feed back the answer to gemini and ask it to give us a valid python code that we can run to give an accurate estimate of CO2 offset the activity has created.
- Gemini uses text and image data to ask clarifying questions and based on the answer help us calculate an activity specific number.

There are social and gamify features to the app as well. Where the more you share with people and more you save the environment, you unlock new characters and achievements.

Flashbacks;The next yet historical button for Google Maps.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ixz-wqsHm8;"What my app does: Recreate segments of symbolic historical event of a location with AR and give then-and-now answers to questions about the subjects relating to the event. It acts as a concept button for the Google Maps, offering a feature that is only applicable to those who is present at the place.

How I used the Gemini API:

- Created my tuned model with structured prompt. Input is about a subject and output is the then-and-now summary of the situation of the subject. The ""then"" refers to the period of April 30th, 1975 when the Saigon administration fell and marked the end of The Vietnam War.

- The subject can be something like ""children"", ""adults"", ""markets"", ""political voices around the world towards the war"", ""the contemporary president of the U.S."", ""cars"", or ""jobs"", ... The output has to give insights into the subject and if applicable, the difference about the subject between Vietnam and the U.S. I use GPT-4o to generate the training data (Yes, I did double check some of it).

- Using the tuned model: I set the system instruction as ""You have insights into the war from the perspectives of a diplomat, a soldier, a normal Vietnamese, and a normal American. You cherish the past that the two nations share and look forward to the future"". Unfortunately, I haven't finished completely.";Android, ARCore;The flashbacks team;Vietnam;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/flashbacks

One of them is to get lemma forms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)). For example, to convert ƒ??runningƒ?? into ƒ??runƒ??.
Also it is used to get important translations: often words have a lot of translations, most of them are rarely used, but flashcards are small, so finding the right ones is very important.

Powered by the Google Gemini API, my free multi-language app named ƒ??Gaze Linkƒ?? helps ALS patients communicate with their eyes independently, accurately, and efficiently.

First, I recognize the userƒ??s face and eyes with Google ML Kit and OpenCV. After a 30-second calibration and setting adjustments, the user can begin typing words on Gaze Linkƒ??s multi-language keyboard with 6 eye gestures. However, eye-typing can be a very slow process for long sentences.

To improve the text-entry rate, I used a Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate the patientƒ??s intended sentence based on keywords and the context. First, Gaze Link will transcribe the caretakerƒ??s voice into text like ƒ??Is the room temperature ok?ƒ??. Then, the patient will type keywords like ƒ??hot, AC, twoƒ?? with their eyes. The Gemini model will use the information to generate a suitable sentence like ƒ??I am hot, can you turn the AC down by 2 degrees?ƒ?? in under a second. The model and keyboard also works with Spanish and Chinese. Experiments with 30 people show that the model can save up to 85% of user keystrokes and make Gaze Link 7x more effective than traditional E-transfer boards.";Android, Firebase, Google ML Kit;Xiangzhou Sun;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/gaze-link
GBA - Proof of Concept;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynrgLeXBTOI;"Generative Based Authentication (GBA) is an innovative authentication method developed by 4DA. This app is just a proof of concept and the emphasis is on the sign-in phase.

Sign-Up Process:
Email Link: The user receives an email containing a link to a story generator powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT.
Story Creation: The user generates a story of their choice using the provided generator.
Story Approval: Once the user is satisfied with the story, it is saved, completing the sign-up process.
Sign-In Process:
Email Submission: To sign in, the user provides their registered email address.
Story-Based Question: The system presents a question based on the unique story generated during sign-up.
Authentication: If the user correctly answers the question, access is granted. If not, access is denied.
Additional Features:
Story Modification: Users can change their story at any time, along with the way questions are generated and answered.
Web-Based Convenience: The entire process is web-based, eliminating the need for any extra app installations.
Device Compatibility: Unlike many authentication apps like BankID, which require modern smart devices and may no longer work on older devices, GBA only requires access to a web browser, ensuring broader compatibility and accessibility.";;Samuel Ferrer (CTO and developer), Alexei Martinez (CLO and assistant);Sweden;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/gba-proof-of-concept

When dealing with a problem, it is quite common, that there already exists out there, problem or solution similar in structure to what we are trying to solve.
The main idea here is that using Gemini Large-Language Model, we can detect structural similarities, or analog, between our problem, with problems from many other domains. We use that, to draw inspirations from invented solutions from other domains. In principle these solutions can be drawn by combining information from various knowledge databases, including Patents, academic journals, Wikipedia etc.

Gemini Automod is a tool/application for assisted moderation support for Garry's Mod game servers using Google's artificial intelligence technology ""Gemini"".

The application records all player activity in logs, based on parameters predefined by the user, the artificial intelligence can suggest actions to be performed by the staff on certain players with strange behavior (breaking rules, harassing players, actions harmful to the server, etc.) using the logs.

This process of interacting with players who break the rules is called moderation, and the application is designed to assist the staff in this process. Because the player who breaks the rules or acts in a harmful way can lie or manipulate the staff, the application can help the staff to have a more accurate view of the situation.

GeminiSMS;Empowering you with Gemini, no internet required.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDmmSPaEu0;"The conversation around AI takes internet access for granted. But for most of the world, the internet is prohibitively expensive. In fact, some of the poorest countries in the world have the highest costs. This means that people who can benefit the most from AI and LLMs like Google Gemini, are the least likely to be able to access it. That is why we came up with GeminiSMS. GeminiSMS gives you the power of Google Gemini, without the internet. Whether you're looking to bridge the digital divide or enhance local innovation, GeminiSMS aims to empower communities in even the most remote areas by offering Gemini via SMS.
Steps:
SMS: The process begins when a user sends an SMS to a special number. This text message could be queries or information that the user wishes to use AI for.
Communications Client: The incoming SMS is received by a communications client, which forwards the message to a server using a webhook. Gemini: The server uses Google Gemini to generate a response which is limited to 150 characters due to SMS limitations.
Reply: The reply is then sent back to the user through the same communications client. Impact:
The project addresses a significant gap in digital access. GeminiSMS functions 100% offline for the users. This is useful in areas with unreliable or expensive internet services. Using SMS, which is often available for cheaper prices even in remote locations, GeminiSMS provides a way for people in remote areas to interact with cutting-edge AI technology.";;GeminiSMS;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/geminisms

GitWatt;Analyze your git repository by AI and get real-world costs;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k2guDd7GgA;"Project Name: GitWatt

Overview: GitWatt allows users to determine various real-world costs associated with running code from a Git repository, including power consumption, carbon footprint, and public cloud expenses.

Mechanism:
- Git Repository Analysis: The project analyzes the code components and minimum resource specifications (CPU, RAM) needed to run the code. Since the Gemini API doesn't natively analyze Git URLs, LangChain was utilized.

- Cloud Instance Data Collection: For AWS, we parsed instance information provided in JSON format. For GCP, we built a custom web crawler using Selenium to collect data by running simulations on the GCP Cloud Calculator and storing the results in our database.

- Efficiency Comparison: We compare the specs of AWS and GCP instances to analyze power consumption and carbon footprint for running an instance for an hour, using Gemini.
Scoring and Recommendations: The tool then ranks and displays the most efficient cloud instance options for executing the code, based on various cost factors.

- Ultimately, GitWatt provides insights into the various costs associated with running Git code, including cloud simulation results and real-world expenses.

Giul-IA;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsW7sFYutOg;giulIA was born from a reflection made almost forty years ago. Will machines ever be able to think and make autonomous decisions? But... what is thought? If I think or dream, I do it in Italian. An Englishman, however, thinks in English. What if language was the mother of thought? At that time I thought that the key to everything was to be able to make a machine generate contextualized text. If the machine generates text, could it think? I wondered... Maybe if the machine could convert images into text descriptions. Could it also think based on what it sees? Dragon Dictate could be used to convert words into text and give it as input. Could it therefore feel? But the time was not ripe. For almost forty years I have carried these questions with me, cataloging them as pure science fiction. But here come the LLM models. They are exactly what I needed to test my ideas.GiulIA is a prototype of artificial intelligence.It generates text but processes it as if it were its own thought stimulated by a particular input, a text, the value of a sensor or even just the passage of time.This thought leads giulIA to decisions (also influenced by its current emotional state) on how to respond or what to do based on its own action list.

Imagine a chatbot where you can start a conversation with Gemini, and then seamlessly switch over to ChatGPT or Llama or another language model, who can pick up the thread and continue the conversation based on the previous model's understanding.

Contextual Understanding: Each model can build upon the context established by the previous one. This allows for richer conversations where the chatbot's memory and understanding of the conversation flow consistently, even as you switch models.
Diverse Perspectives: Switching models lets you tap into different AI personalities and approaches. One model might be better at creative writing, while another might excel at factual information. By combining them, your app could offer a more rounded and insightful response.
Improved Accuracy: By utilizing multiple models, the app could potentially overcome the limitations of any one model, leading to more accurate and reliable information.
Technical Considerations:
Model Communication: You'll need a way to smoothly transfer the conversation's context from one model to the next. This requires clever technical solutions to ensure a seamless handover.

Glow Alarm;A visual alarm system for the deaf and hard of hearing.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ticysXQrvU;"GlowAlarm is a new mobile app developed for the deaf and hard of hearing.It was created to overcome the limitations of existing emergency alert systems. The core of GlowAlarm is to convert information that cannot be heard into visual signals. This allows users with hearing difficulties to quickly respond to emergency situations without missing critical information.

GlowAlarm works in conjunction with smart light bulbs. When an emergency occurs, GlowAlarm immediately controls the connected smart bulbs. The bulbs emit light in various colors and flashing patterns depending on the severity and type of the situation. For example, rapid red flashes signal immediate danger, while slow yellow blinks indicate caution.

GlowAlarm's key function is prioritizing disaster alerts and controlling bulbs accordingly. It distinguishes between non-urgent notifications like heat advisories and life-threatening alerts like earthquake warnings. We use Gemini API, an LLM, to automate this complex analysis and risk classification.

We prioritized recall over precision, as detecting all dangerous situations is crucial in safety-critical contexts. Recall measures how comprehensively actual dangers are detected. Through continuous prompt optimization with the Gemini API, we maximized recall, accepting cases where lower-level incidents might be classified as higher-level ones to ensure optimal safety. This approach minimizes the risk of missing any dangerous situations that could threaten user safety.";Flutter, Firebase;Glow Alarm;South Korea;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/glow-alarm

Grantyd;Using AI to help grant writers eliminate the copy/paste.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_vqexcgRy4;Grantyd is a chrome extension that uses Gemini + Vertex AI datastore to streamline grant applications. It's acts as a personal assistant that reads your documents and auto-fills applications, saving grant writers time and energy. Grantyd was built to eliminate tedious copy-pasting by application questions and generating accurate answers based on uploaded documents, minimizing errors and making the process much faster. The main use of Gemini is in its ability to accept tools outside of just rest APIs, and in my case I use a custom datastore for each user's initiatives to act as a vertex ai search retrieval tool for every application package response. I also use Gemini's JSON output feature to parse the data in a second step to make it type safe with almost no effort.

The core of Graphite is Graphite Chat, a conversational assistant powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro. While writing in the editor on the left, Graphite Chat, always available on the right, knows what you've written. This constant context allows Graphite to be a powerful writing assistant.
However, Graphite, through Gemini's Tool Call API, is also able to store key details about your text into a custom LLM Long-Term Memory, which allows it to recall these details accurately far into a conversation. Coupled with Gemini 1.5 Pro's 2 million token context window, Graphite can accurately recall any important details about what you are writing.
The most important part of Graphite resides in its powerful Suggestion capabilities. When asking it to help you revise your document or to help you write, Graphite is able to again draw on Gemini's Tool Call API to directly give suggestions on your text. You can choose to dismiss or accept these suggestions, all with a single click.

[Concepts]
- Eco Action: Actions that contribute, even slightly, to environmental improvement. (e.g., a photo of picking up trash, a drawing by Green Bot, a URL to news or blogs).
- Eco Coin: Virtual currency used to support other people's Eco Actions.
- Green Bot: AI bot at the core of the app that helps users add Eco Actions and issue Eco Coins through chat.

[Features]
- Users can add Eco Actions, make app improvement suggestions, and receive Eco Coins as rewards through chats with Green Bot.
- Users can support Eco Actions added by others using Eco Coins and add comments.
- The user input UI is standardized to a chat format, emphasizing that the foundation of the app is ""conversation"".
- By long-tapping text, users can request Green Bot to translate, summarize, and more.
- Admin Bot

[Usage of Gemini API]

Greengrade;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NA4eGBh0m0;"Greengrade is an app capable of mathematically quantifying and standardizing the concept of sustainability using Sustainability Interval Index (SII) analysis. We leverage Googleƒ??s Gemini's ability to summarize and find values from Sustainability Reports, Quarterly Financial Statements, or databases to gather the data necessary to provide an accurate score for a particular company.

Originally, to test out our model, we manually inputted the metrics for 190 companies. Most of this information is hard to find, unavailable, incorrect, misleading, and would takes weeks to compile, but Gemini cuts this time down drastically, helping us make this app as accessible and easy to use as possible by people concerned with sustainability and corporate responsibility.

In addition to integrating Gemini into the app to expedite the extraction process, we utilized prompt engineering to ask Gemini for reliable sources on the internet to provide third-party estimates in addition to our own to verify company self-reporting.

We also integrated Gemini to interpret the output. Manually, we can only rank companies against each other. But with Gemini, it juxtaposes the companyƒ??s self-promotion regarding sustainability with its actual sustainability score. Additionally, it suggests economic ramifications such as investor interest due to impact from sustainability, and discusses the possible legal risk of the environmental impact.

But what if you're visually impaired? You'd use a blind reader, such as macOS's VoiceOver. So you open a file manager window, and VoiceOver describes, in detail, what it is and can do (every time you use it!). You use complex keyboard actions to navigate to the sidebar. Whenever you interact with your device, VoiceOver repeats information about the focused UI element. You then go down the list of folders, one by one, with VoiceOver announcing every folder's name until you finally hear the correct folder. The process is repeated inside the folder until you find your desired file. Wasn't that exasperating?

The doctor to patient ratio is so alarmingly low that doctors cannot fulfill their duties with utmost care and efficacy. Moreover rural folks are usually less tech savvy and educationally backward, leading to them not fully following doctor's advice or doing regular checkups.

Which is why CHWs exist. While their work is commendable globally, they have their own special problems. Lack of formal medical education, digital tooling and poor ratios have also led to them not being deployed super effectively. And hence HealthRanger exists.

HealthRanger augments CHWs with better tools for more effective medical surveys and referrals, automated follow-up tools and AI powered case management software at their tooltips.

How Do You Feel?;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8dsfJNGqA;"Our Emotion Analyzer app is tool designed to help users gain deeper insights into their emotional state using advanced AI technology. Here's how it works and how we've integrated the Gemini API:

The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can input their current feelings and thoughts. Once the user submits their input, our app leverages the Gemini API to perform a comprehensive analysis of the expressed emotions.

We utilize the Gemini API through the Google Generative AI package in Dart. The process begins by initializing a GenerativeModel with specific configurations tailored for emotion analysis. We set parameters like temperature, topK, and topP to fine-tune the AI's response generation.

The app sends the user's input to the Gemini model along with a carefully crafted prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to:

1. Extract and list key emotions from the user's input.
2. Provide a brief summary of the overall emotional state.
3. Offer a supportive message based on the analyzed emotions.
4. Respond in a personal, empathetic tone.

The Gemini API processes this request and returns a structured response. Our app then displays this response to the user, presenting:

- A list of identified emotions
- A concise summary of their emotional state
- A supportive message tailored to their current feelings

IRIS 1;From Damage Control to Damage Prevention;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRx_03QeXAc;"Iris transforms the way people and businesses censor sensitive data in mass.

Millions of users share videos on social media everyday. However, the current system struggles to detect and remove sensitive information in real-time. Videos containing passwords and personally identifiable information (PII) like addresses, credit card details and IDs are frequently taken down only after user reports, which can be too late since the information has already been leaked.

This is where Iris steps in. By analyzing visual data for any sensitive data leaks before the video is published, we can solve the problem at its source.

Here's how it works: Clients upload their videos through an API request. These videos are encrypted in Firebase, processed on GCP, and analyzed for sensitive info. Our internal database of sensitive info is collected only on the consent of our users, who receive a decrease in their subscription fee. This data will then be deleted after a 30 day retention period. A report is generated, allowing clients to customize blur settings. Finally, IRIS returns a censored video with requested PII blurred.

We use Google Gemini 1.5 Pro to analyze any potential information leak. Additionally, we use RAG to retrieve any matches to our internal sensitive ino database. Google Gemini allows us to detect sensitive data from a semantic perspective. So more complex cases of PII and password leakage like mirrored or occluded texts can also be detected.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;Iris;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/iris-1

2) Condenses the chat history into a standalone question such that we can keep our prompts small
3) Tailors the responses to the user based on their question and the data retrieved.

Journey Hub;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9HH2ce8g8k;"In the Journey Hub App, we harness the unique capabilities of the Gemini API, specifically the Gemini Pro model, to conduct highly precise, metropolitan area-specific searches. When a user submits a request via the Flutter app, Firestore is immediately updated with their prompt. We then employ a vector index in Firestore, containing embeddings and associated intents, to perform a nearest neighbor search. This process identifies the user's intent, such as seeking cooling centers or medical help, by matching it with predefined intents within the app.

Geminiƒ??s standout feature is its ability to deliver highly localized searches. Once the user's intent is identified, Gemini performs a focused, location-specific search within the user's metropolitan area, retrieving relevant data like cooling centers or medical facilities. This ensures that users receive timely, context-specific information tailored precisely to their geographic location.

The data retrieved through Gemini is then formatted using the Instructor Python library to ensure clarity and relevance before being presented to the user. This capability not only provides immediate, location-based assistance but also allows for ongoing refinement. As users provide feedback, we will continuously update the intent vectors to enhance the accuracy and relevance of future searches, making the app smarter and more responsive over time.";Flutter, Android, Web/Chrome, Firebase, Firestore, Vector Indexes, Gemini Pro Model, Gemini Embedding Model, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Cloud Functions, Firebase Crashlytics, Remote Config, Firebase Analytics, ;Neil Jay Warner, Eric Livesay, David Allen, Carlos Doble, Trey Henry, Ladis Aguilar, James Henry;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/journey-hub

The core of the game is an advanced AI-driven system that generates unique, immersive stories for each player, blending human creativity with AI innovation.

At the heart of Journey Together is an AI prompt mechanism that utilizes various inputs to tailor each narrative. The AI processes JSON objects that include user data (such as age and preferences), game elements (like unlocked features, equipped items, and selected avatars), and contextual information from previous stories. These inputs are fed into the AI, which then generates a script for the adventure, complete with interactive questions, challenges, and opportunities for players to use items from their inventory or explore different paths on the map.

Multiplayer functionality is supported through Firebase, where a ""Host"" player creates a story that others can join. Communication between players and the AI is managed via Firebase Database, ensuring real-time updates and interactions. The AI not only crafts the story but also maintains continuity by referencing details from prior adventures, enhancing immersion.

The game also features AI-generated voice narration (in English), enriching the storytelling experience. Players earn rewards as they progress, which can be used to unlock new abilities, customize avatars, and further personalize their adventures.";Flutter, Firebase, Google Text to Speech voice generation;Journey Together Team;Spain;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/journey-together

Korean Test Companion addresses this lack of variety by letting the user generate questions based on original texts to practice for common Korean language tests. It uses Gemini to generate texts based on topics chosen by the user, and questions about the generated texts. The prompts Gemini receives ensure the question and level are similar to previous questions of a common Korean test. It also uses Gemini to detect difficult words in the generated texts and provide definitions that are contextually relevant, helping the user learn new words about topics they are less familiar with. The user can also save texts and bookmark difficult words for later reference.

LangFlip;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YsfN3WEGLg;"Langflip relies heavily on the Gemini Multimodal API. It will send the original video to Gemini and ask Gemini to :
1. Generate captions for the videos, one of the main complexities of translating videos is maintaining the rhythm of the original video. For example, if we want to translate an English video into German, it is very likely that the translation will have more words and will be longer than the original video. Gemini gives the ability to detect when the speaker takes a break and group the caption until a break.
2. Generate the translations, again, we want to maintain the rhythm of the original videos. Google Translate will provide a literal translation of the original sentences. However, we want translations that are more or less the same length as the original video. Gemini gives the ability to generate translations with more or less the same number of characters than the original sentence translated.
3. Detect which frames need to be lip-synced, we want to send only the frames where the speaker is clearly visible and talking to the lip-syncing AI model. If we send frames with no visible face to the AI, it might crash and fail the lip-syncing process.

Liberge;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utUPY4luwoI;"Liberge is a social platform designed to enhance university life by connecting students for shared activities and keeping them informed about club events. Students create profiles using their university email, specifying their name, gender, faculty, year, preferred activities, and optionally uploading photos.

The app addresses two core challenges:
1. Finding activity partners
2. Staying updated on university events.

To solve the first problem, Liberge allows students to create posts about activities they want to do, such as playing billiards. These posts are visible to students from the same university. Interested students can send requests to join, which may include personalized notes. Once a request is accepted, a chatroom is created for further discussion and planning.

For the second challenge, Liberge offers a dedicated page for student clubs to post events. Students can join these events, see who else is attending, view event details, and receive notifications as the event approaches, ensuring they never miss out.

Liberge leverages the Gemini API in its Post feature to ensure that content shared by students meets certain standards. When a student creates a post, the app validates the content in the background using Gemini API. Only if the content is deemed valid by the API, the post is allowed to be shared. This integration ensures that the platform remains safe and appropriate for all users, fostering a positive and engaging community.";Android, Firebase;Liberge;Azerbaijan;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/liberge

Ludovik;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YX54QWzH4;"Ludovik is a mobile app for Android and iPhone. By taking a photo of a board game's rules, it can provide a short description of the game, summarize the rules, and if needed, you can ask a specific question about a rule and get an answer! No more long interruptions during gameplay to check the rules!

The idea for the app was born at the FLIP 2024 (Festival Ludique International de Parthenay) in France. We had to test about twenty games to win a small, characteristic plush toy from the festival (a Woopy), so we had to immerse ourselves in numerous rulebooks over a weekend, spending a lot of time reading, rereading, and checking the rules. And we thought it would be super convenient to have an app that could do this for us!

As a developer, I couldn't let this idea just sit there, and I took advantage of the competition opportunity to get started. Gemini is perfect for reworking the text of the rules that I extract from photos using OCR with Google ML Kit. I also use Gemini Pro to manage the rule summary and categorize the game. Finally, Gemini Flash allows me to handle the question-and-answer part of the rules, since I provide it with all the rules, I need less of Gemini Pro's power, and this allows me to get the answer super fast!

I have many other ideas for growing Ludovik where I could use Gemini, such as setting up the game, calculating scores by taking photos of the players's plates, etc., etc.

Using the Gemini API, these replicas engage in complex conversations, understand advanced contexts, and provide precise, personalized responses, making interactions feel natural and intimate. Unlike traditional chatbots, our app utilizes prompt engineering and one-shot learning to create a long-term memory system that adapts to the userƒ??s personality. MAIƒ??s advanced algorithms assess user compatibility through communication styles, preferences, and values. By combining traditional algorithms with NLP techniques like LIWC and vector similarity, MAI fosters genuine connections. The system refines match parameters by tracking conversation volumes and user behavior. Once high compatibility is reached, users can smoothly transition from virtual to real-life interactions, helping those with social anxiety build confidence.
We also use Firebase to track user interactions, tailors app experiences, and enables dynamic updates for personalized use.";Android, Firebase;X1;Vietnam;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/mai-my-mates-ai

MantisGem;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwykrMWl1jQ;"Our app remedies a common problem that most users of LLMs face. Many users are interested in getting recommendations for activities or exploring options that are suitable to their specific needs given their general preferences or particular circumstances at the moment when they are querying. However, they are often stuck with responses that are too generic to serve their specific needs.

A skilled human assistant would remedy this as follows: ask them pertinent questions that help them to narrow their options, and gather information that may not be directly relevant but could help understand the user's thought process. The former relates to flipped interactions and chain-of-thought prompting, which have been areas where AI has advanced significantly. The latter, on the other hand, relates to tools from cognitive psychology and behavioral analysis.

We have utilized the ability of Gemini to perform the former, where we take the user's queries and combine it with a request to perform flipped interactions. This is done through API calls. The latter is more delicate and not straightforward, and hence we have used several handpicked training examples designed using a combination of Gemini and ideas inspired by the psychology literature. Thus our model utilizes innate abilities of Gemini and questioning patterns suggested by the examples to direct the conversation with the user in a way that best extracts relevant information from the user and guides them to the desirable output.";Web/Chrome, Google Docs & Google Drive;No Veni Vedi Vici, Venam Vidu Machi!;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/mantisgem

Tracking symptoms, meals, and medications becomes crucial, but jotting down notes feels like a chore. Simplify your health-tracking journey with MediLog, designed to make health-tracking and caregiving more effortless.

Following is the description of how we use Gemini API in our app:

For the Create Profile feature, Gemini API is used to extract information such as name, sex, age, weight, food allergy, medicine allergy, and medical history from user voice recording.
For the Voice Logging feature, Gemini API is used to find out what type of health information the user mentioned in the audio, then the app will open any relatable sheets that the user must confirm.
When logging Food intake using images, Gemini API is used to find out the name of the food based on user location, and its common ingredients. If the food contains any allergen that the user is allergic to, it will alert the user.
Lastly, Gemini API is also used to generate a health report based on period and language that the user chooses. Let's say the user chooses a 1-month period, then MediLog will send 1 month's worth of user logs data to Gemini API to be summarized.

The customized AI-generated report will be convenient in an emergency situation where healthcare professionals may require data on the patient's condition over the past few days so that they can quickly narrow down any action that needs to be taken immediately.";Flutter, Firebase, Cloud KMS, Cloud Function;HasToDev;Indonesia;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/medilog

MoodMind;Personalized Mood Tracker: Unveil Your Emotions, Empower Your Day;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYwS1ThBzNE;"MoodMind is an emotion detection system integrated with personalized recommendations based on the detected emotions. The system uses `cv2` (OpenCV) for capturing video frames and `DeepFace` for emotion analysis.

Based on the detected emotion, the Gemini API is called to generate a recommendation. The API call requests a short, five-word recommendation tailored to the specific emotion. The recommendations are dynamically generated for each detected emotion: happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise, fear, and disgust.

The captured video frame is displayed with overlay text showing the user's name, age, detected emotion, and the corresponding recommendation from the Gemini API. The video feed updates in real-time, continuously analyzing and providing recommendations until the user decides to quit the session by closing the video feed.

The Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is initialized to handle the content generation. For each detected emotion, the model's `generate_content` method is called with a prompt to generate a short recommendation. The generated text is then displayed on the video feed.

Additionally, the system stores user data, including name, age, detected emotion, and recommendation, in Firebase Firestore. The video feed updates every 10 seconds, capturing the current frame, analyzing the emotion, generating a recommendation, and storing the data in Firestore.";Flutter, Web/Chrome, Firebase;BeezGroup;Uganda;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/moodmind
Moom;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tEQFdwWVT4;"Moom is an AI architecture and interior design kit that puts the focus on people who live in the space. Typically, image generation with generative AI requires a text prompt and it often lacks scale interpretation. In the design workflow, visual communication helps convey concepts effectively and bridges the gap in interpretation. Moom integrates 2D image generation with a 3D model to enhance scale accuracy. To construct the 3D model, we use Gemini API to search our 3D model database that matches user needs and visual input.
The Gemini API extracts significant features from each furniture piece in the database and from the user's moodboard, which consists of a set of images. Currently, we focus on ƒ??overall mood and toneƒ?? and ƒ??colorƒ?? as the main attributes. These features are then embedded using a text-embedding model. Gemini is used to suggest furniture categories based on users input, such as age range and specific requirements. We retrieve the suggested furniture categories from the database and present results with the highest similarity score. This 3d model will be combined with layout suggestion algorithms and used as the basis for image generation in the next step.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;Maitai Kunawong, Praejeen Kunawong, Sopitta Thurachen, Krongkwan Kananurak;Thailand;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/moom

The API detects various objects in the image and returns a list of relevant things in the picture. Users select a keyword from this list, instantly connecting them to a global group chat where others are discussing the same topic. Additionally, users can chat with an AI specifically about the chosen topic, enhancing their learning and connection to their surroundings. This feature also offers comfort to those who might feel lonely or need a positive distraction, inspired by concepts from ƒ??The Power of Nowƒ??, and helps a lot with reducing social anxiety.

The appƒ??s potential is vast. For example, we could partner with brands like Coca-Cola, where users can snap a picture of a product to join a special group chat and access exclusive offers. Friends could use a secret object as a password to create private groups, and there are many more possibilities.

I've utilized the Gemini-1.5-Flash model for both image analysis and the AI chat functionality, as itƒ??s lightweight and provides accurate responses for this MVP.

Mosaic Learn;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDkt2xQK4ZA;"I am a rising senior in high school (12th grade) interested in computer science and software engineering. While I am a self-directed learner, my classmates often ask my help to explain concepts in a more ""user-friendly"" manner, leading me to harness the power of ""teaching them to fish""ƒ??guiding them to understand the underlying principles, instead of explaining individual problems. To address this educational gap, I worked on a mobile application that allows users to scan textbook pages and receive links to YouTube videos for further learning. This way, my peers can more easily learn core concepts without being completely lost.
Mosaic Learn is an application built on top of React Native and Expo for the Front end and Firebase, Gemini Dev API and YouTube Search API on the backend. When a user takes a picture of a document in our UI, we use Google MLKit for cross-platform text extraction. We then send this information to the Gemini 1.5 Flash API for parsing and return a JSON with a summary of the document and an array of search terms. We then feed these search terms into the YouTube results API and save the returned results to Firebase, so users can access their scan history.

Motion Magic Physics Simulator;Motion Magic is the all-in-one physics education tool.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkOXYj_hd8;"Motion Magic was created to solve a critical problem in physics education: the need for reliable, on-demand, step-by-step solutions that students can trust. In a world where online resources are often behind paywalls or lack accuracy, Motion Magic leverages advanced AI to deliver precise answers.

The app leverages Gemini for the AI solver, processing physics problems by prompting Gemini in a specific format. Gemini returns a JSON that includes the problem text, set of known values, and an array of steps. Each step contains the equation to use, the variable to solve for, and the explanation.

To address the limitations of LLMs in complex math computations, our app handles all calculations internally. This approach ensures accurate results and reduces response time.

As the JSON data is being streamed, it's processed in real-time. This means that instead of waiting until receiving the entire response, the app begins displaying processed problem text, variables, and steps as soon as enough data is available. This way, the app can display step 1 within 3 to 4 secs, rather than waiting 10 to 12 secs for the entire response. This method enhances the user experience by providing fast and accurate solutions.

Beyond the AI solver, Motion Magic offers a wide range of physics tools, including physics simulations and a note-taking mode. This allows students to visualize concepts and organize their studies all in one place.

MyGourmet;Food Memories at a Glance;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWxBYqiXnSI;"#App Overview
This app uses AI to analyze and save only photos taken at restaurants on a smartphone. Itƒ??s designed for food enthusiasts who love visiting cafes and restaurants. Unlike apps like Google Photos, which can mix up search results.
AI filters local photos to save those related to food. The app then uses Gemini to categorize these photos automatically, making it easier to browse and reflect on dining experiences. While categorization is currently server-side, future updates will allow users to customize categories, leveraging Geminiƒ??s image classification capabilities.
Using the Google Place API, the app links photos to specific restaurant locations based on geotagging. This process is typically manual, but here itƒ??s automated with Geminiƒ??s API and Googleƒ??s review data, making it easier to track restaurant visits.
#App Architecture
The app classifies photos, saving food-related ones to Firebase Storage. Gemini is implemented as an API to categorize photos. By leveraging the assigned categories, along with the Google Map API and AI-based text analysis, the app automatically links the photos to restaurant data. This allows users to easily preserve memories of the restaurants they visited simply by taking photos.

The main idea was to built alternative to Google Drive, but 12 days is not much, so I've made website with minimal tasking feature and dektop app which uses local filesystem and connectivy to server to suggest tasks over files.

Nouro FS analyzes files by following principle:
- Download on server max 15MB of file
- Devide file into smaller part, which is based on file type
- Transform file into text
- Define AI Tasks
- Interate over AI to get Suggestions
- Run AI Suggestions

This process allows to scale app into various situations , tasks, and file formats.
Currently in app available text, image, video, audio, documents and spreadsheets file formats. With only 3 tasks as rename, move and tag files.

App devides into 4 parts:
- Server: where is main logic, analyzing and processing
- Cloud Functions: to run analyzing when upload to storage
- Front-end app: something like google drive, but with minimal features
- Desktop app: watched specified dir, and tracks added files, then gives suggestions to end user

NPC Dialogue Master AI;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFucmF2YWrU;"NPC Dialogue Master AI streamlines the creation of dynamic and contextually accurate NPC dialogue for game developers. The core functionality of our app is to generate rich, evolving NPC interactions by leveraging the Gemini API, specifically the Gemini Text Model and Gemini Semantic Retrieval.

The process begins with developers structuring their gameƒ??s lore using a standard wiki format. Gemini Semantic Retrieval is used to index and categorize this lore, ensuring that all relevant details such as characters, locations, ect, are easily accessible.

Using our UI form, developers can define the purpose, personality, and context of each NPC by selecting from the same metadata used during the lore upload. This ensures that every dialogue is generated with the most accurate and relevant information. Once the NPC setup is complete, the UI generates a JSON object containing all the necessary parameters.

This JSON object is then integrated into Unreal Engine, where, during gameplay, Semantic Retrieval gathers the most relevant context, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gemini Text Model request. This process allows for dynamically generated NPC dialogue in real-time, ensuring that NPCs consistently reflect the latest updates in the gameƒ??s world, without requiring manual script revisions.

NPC Dialogue Master AI thus simplifies the dialogue creation process, enabling developers to maintain narrative consistency while focusing on building engaging and immersive game worlds.";Google Cloud Platform;Javier Enriquez, Kiefer Traub;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/npc-dialogue-master-ai

OvaCare AI;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UdnFR62iqw;"My Flutter application, designed for early detection of ovarian cancer subtype classification, leverages the Gemini API to provide a powerful tool for doctors. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, largely due to late stage diagnosis, given the often vague and inconsistent initial symptoms. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant on histopathology image analysis by pathologists using microscopic examination, face complexity and inconsistency, leading to moderate agreement among specialists.
This application introduces a histotype-based ovarian cancer subtype classification framework employing multiple instance learning and deep learning algorithms on histopathology images.

PainApp;Uses Gemini to create visualization exercises to help your brain heal.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yac-EuC2ebw;"PainApp is built on the principle of neuroplasticity - the brain's ability to rewire itself. It guides the user through a series of interactive exercises designed to promote positive neurotransmitter production, followed by personalized visualization sessions generated via the Gemini API. Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin help our brains to create and strengthen new synapses and learn new pathways.

We begin by asking users to describe their pain experience. This information is then used by Gemini to create tailored visualization scripts and mantras, helping users focus their attention on a pain-free state. The goal is to facilitate a shift in neural pathways associated with chronic pain.

Thank you to my parents who volunteered to test this app out and appear in this video. My step mother Jen had 8/10 hip pain. By the end of the exercises her hip was pain free! My dad, Tony, has significant pain. We focused on his tailbone pain. While it did not completely go away, it was dramatically reduced. He asked, ""What are you doing to me?"" I told him it was Gemini who was helping!

If we visualize ourselves as pain free, and especially in the presence of good neurotransmitters we can teach our brains to create new, healthy, pain-free pathways.

PDF MINIMALIZER APP;CHANGE THE BOOKS INTO EASY ENGLISH VERSION (without its flow);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqXR-VegBmU;"My app simplifies difficult text in PDF books, making it easier to read for non-native English speakers. The app is designed to help users understand complex language and improve their vocabulary by breaking down hard words and sentences into simpler English.

Here's how it works:

1.Text Extraction: The app uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from PDF files. This allows it to process books that are in scanned or image formats.

2.Simplifying Text: The core feature of the app involves using the Google Gemini API. After extracting the text, the app sends it to the Gemini API, which rephrases complex sentences and identifies difficult words.

3.Replacement and Output: The app uses regular expressions to extract and replace difficult words with simpler definitions provided by the API. Users can choose between two modes: Beginner and Intermediate. The Beginner mode simplifies the text more thoroughly, while the Intermediate mode provides more challenging vocabulary to help users gradually improve their English skills.

4.Results: Finally, the app generates a text file with the simplified content, making it easier to read and understand. This output can be a valuable tool for learners who struggle with advanced English texts.

Users can publish their stories or keep them private on their shelf. They can browse through a vast library of stories in various genres, read them, or immerse themselves by listening. Stories can be liked or saved for later reading.

Pictorica unleashes the true potential of Gemini's cutting-edge capabilities by:

1. Craft Stories with Your Pictures: Choose any genre and write in your favorite author's style using just your rough story idea and a main character, if desired. This is made possible by integrating Gemini's Multi-Modal Input and configurable safety settings.

Poopie Gemini;AI-powered insights and statistics for advanced gut health tracking;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o58Ga8L3cMg;"Poopie is a unique social app already in production, designed to break taboos around discussing digestive health. Many people feel embarrassed about poops, so we created a platform where users can connect socially while gaining health insights. For our current submission, we focus solely on Poopieƒ??s advanced gut health tracking, enhanced with AI analytics through Gemini.

Our app is designed for users seeking deeper insights into their digestive health, it provides comprehensive data logging, personalized insights, and clear statistical analysis.

Users can log detailed information about bowel movements, such as stool composition, volume, color, and conditions. The intuitive interface simplifies tracking, and personal notes about meals or symptoms can be added for context.

For AI analysis, we used the official google_generative_ai package to access the Gemini API, ideal for prototyping. Users can select a date range for analysis, and the app sends their logs within that period to Gemini. The API uses a detailed system instruction, found in the code, to analyze the data. The insights and recommendations returned are displayed on the UI, helping users understand their gut health comprehensively and identify potential issues or improvements.

Pro Formula;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepsbUFQDAE;There are three problems I wanted to solve. First, as we acquire more knowledge, human brains are limited to remembering all of it. Instead of using our cognitive resources on memorization, I propose leveraging AI to assist us in focusing our brainpower on other pursuits, ultimately leading us to a better future through creative and innovative technology. Second, while we have developed AI, we often spend too much time crafting prompts to get accurate results. At least in the STEM fields, the knowledge and data that AI is trained on should be verified and certified, which is why I chose this type of customer. Many developers attempting to build AI applications often end up with a chat interface, which isn't always intuitive for humans. Therefore, I tried a different approach, like a ƒ??Multistep Searchƒ??. Third, since human life is short, we have collected and documented our knowledge throughout history to pass on to future generations. When we discover a new theory or knowledge in the STEM field, writing research papers becomes essential for informing and persuading others. This process requires us to include equations or formulas in a digital format. LaTeX offers a way to write mathematical equations in documents easily but still requires manual input, and this is the main theme of my application to make it simple and easier. I believe my application can help save time and increase the efficiency of this process and has some potential to change the future like Google.;Web/Chrome, Lighthouse;SpaceCoder;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/pro-formula

Our HMI analysis creates a 1.5x1.5 mile grid system over the entire state of Massachusetts and acts as custom neighborhoods. The analysis takes raw data from the multiple listing service and aggregates closed prices, closed sales, listed prices, listed homes, price per sqft, days on market, valuation accuracy, land sales, and land listings daily for each custom grid. This data is then given to Gemini through prompt injection based on the neighborhood you are interested in, which allows Gemini to be your market analyst. Have a question on how much should you offer on a home? AiiRE can assist by looking at the Closed vs Listed Prices of that neighborhood and offer a range to assist. Want to know how long it will take to sell your home? AiiRE can help there as well, looking at the Days On Market for that area and advise on how long it most likely will take. All of this information is currently lacking in todayƒ??s real estate world, which is why the goal for AiiRE is twofold: 1) To assist realtors with complex market questions and analysis and 2) be a barometer for listings on Zillow, Redfin, or other sites and offer direct insights and answers to people wanting to buy or sell a home;Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps API, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, FireStore, Hosting, Cloud Functions;Enzle Analytics;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/project-aiire-ai-in-real-estate

Project Stargate;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x7_PHop30o;Project Stargate the AI application is an early prototype for an automated evaluation system (or just a fun sketching/guessing game!) currently stargate utilises the Gemini model to simulate the role of a monitor within a remote viewing session - the monitor in a remote viewing session guides a viewer through a session, attempting them to keep on a signal line and describe the images that come to them in more detail. Gemini is also used to the full multimodal advantage be including in sketch data which typically the programme monitors in a remote viewing session would analyse after a session - this automation gives the AI Monitor (Gemini) 'eyes' to see what the viewer is sketching at a particular time and how these sketches may relate to a clearer picture of a location or object that will be gathered over the session. The application also benefits from use of the Imagen 2 model to generate live models of the potential remote viewing target based on the details provided in the conversation and the sketches (meaning that even as someone as bad at drawing as me can enjoy the process of a remote viewing session too!) some initial groundwork has be laid for the integration of a retrieval augmented generation system into the chatbot with myself developing a Firestore Langchain Record Manager (PR is in) this record manager will allow us to take full advantage of Firestore for document management for the retrieval augmented generation gemini chatbot.

The game offers five difficulty levels: ""Virtual Voyage"" (home), ""City Code Cape"" (within the city), ""State Secret Search"" (within the state), ""National Nautical Nightmare"" (within the country), and ""World Wind Wander"" (worldwide). Players earn 100 points per correct guess, with additional points for uploading receipts or photos analyzed by the Gemini API. If the uploaded image contains the place's name and the app recognizes it with the help of Gemini API, players receive a 10,000-point bonus, ensuring they're physically present. The app is translated into eight languages with ARB files for static text and Google Translation API for clues, though answers must be in English. Features include a heatmap for tracking guesses, game sharing via a game ID, public hunts, a scoreboard prototype, and dark/light themes. Available on Android and iOS, the app has been tested in cities like New Delhi, Paris, and Sšœo Paulo, with Gemini ensuring clue generation works worldwide.";Flutter, Firebase;RiskyStock;India;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/questspot

Why Use LLMs for Quiz Generation?
Creating quizzes for all internet content is daunting, but with LLMs like Gemini, we can generate tailored quizzes from multimodal content, ensuring flexible answers that capture the essence of responses.

How It Works:
Content Extraction:
Quizbo's extractor agent uses the Gemini API to process uploaded content (text, HTML, audio, video, PDFs) into plain text, summarizing texts, transcribing audio/video, and extracting from HTML/PDFs.

Quiz Generation:
The simplified text is sent to Quizbo's quiz generator agent, which uses the Gemini API to generate questions and answers, identifying key concepts and formulating questions that test comprehension.

Tailoring Questions:
Quizbo personalizes quizzes based on user-defined personas using the Gemini API, adjusting difficulty, language, and focus to match the user's role, preferred difficulty level, and learning goals.

Answer Review:
When users submit answers, Quizbo's reviewer agent uses the Gemini API to evaluate responses, considering variations in phrasing, grading pass or fail, and providing insights or explanations.

Students often rely on laptops for note-taking, but when exam time comes, they struggle to recall and apply what theyƒ??ve learned. Memorizing notes alone isnƒ??t enough for exam success.

Recap transforms this process. As students take notes, the integrated Gemini AI extracts key points in real time, highlighting Key Terms and Key Concepts. This helps students focus on essential information. Additionally, a context-aware chatbot is available for deeper understanding.

Recapƒ??s standout feature is its ability to generate unlimited practice questions based on the studentƒ??s notes. These questions come in multiple choice, short answer, and fill-in-the-blank formats. Students receive immediate feedback, with Gemini ensuring that answers are assessed for meaning, not just exact text.

Students can export practice questions as PDFs, filtering by type to customize their study materials. Additionally, the original notes can also be exported as PDFs, allowing for a comprehensive review of both questions and notes. This flexibility enables focused and effective study, whether printed or on a tablet.

Recap helps students retain and internalize knowledge, making their learning both effective and enduring.

The AI has several functionalities:

- It determines the most suitable emergency contact number based on your location and the type of emergency message;
- In emergency situations, messages may not always be clear and concise; the AI can correct and clarify the text;
- If the local language is different from yours, the AI will translate the message content into the local language to assist the authorities.

SAKE PAIRING;An AI-powered sake pairing service;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3RNHLtFBzQ;"Overview
This application is an AI service that pairs Japanese sake or chu-hi with selected dishes. For Japanese sake, it suggests two types, and for chu-hi, it recommends two flavors.

Background
While there are various types of Japanese sake and chu-hi, there are very few services or individuals capable of providing appropriate pairings. This aspect has somewhat remained a black box. Recently, the number of foreign visitors to Japan has exceeded 3 million per month. This service was created to introduce these visitors to the enjoyment of Japanese alcohol, especially those unfamiliar with it.

Gemini API Specifications
In this service, the type of alcohol and the dish image selected by the user are sent to the Gemini API. The API processes the image, generates a description of the appropriate type of alcohol for the dish using LLM data, and displays the result in the UI. The output is designed to be easy to understand, with markdown formatting for clarity. This service leverages Gemini's strength as a multimodal LLM, allowing for quick and accurate image processing. To achieve a balance between speed and quality, we opted for Gemini 1.5 Flash. After comparing various LLMs and checking the accuracy (validity) of the pairing suggestions, Gemini was found to have the highest precision, with an impressive accuracy rate of 96.25% (77 correct pairings out of 80). This is a unique service that showcases the strengths of Gemini and offers something only AI can provide.";;Team Ss;Japan;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/sake-pairing

When a user defines a learning goal, such as ƒ??I want to learn how to use a 3D printer,ƒ?? this input is sent to the Gemini API via Firebaseƒ??s ƒ??Build with Geminiƒ?? integration. The system retrieves system instructions and other parameters from Firebase Remote Config. The Gemini API then generates a structured project plan conforming to a JSON schema.

Gemini also generates context-aware achievements tied to specific, significant steps within the project, providing users with motivational milestones. These achievements are dynamically created by analyzing the project steps and identifying key challenges or milestones that deserve recognition. Additionally, if users have questions during their project, they can ask directly within the app, and the Gemini model generates answers based on pre-configured system instructions.

Launchpadƒ??s use of the Gemini APIs is designed to operate behind the scenes, enabling a smooth and intuitive user experience. By integrating Gemini AI, Launchpad offers a powerful toolset for learners, helping them to navigate complex projects with AI-generated guidance, support, and motivation, all while keeping the userƒ??s focus on the learning journey itself.";Flutter, Android, Firebase, Android Studio;Scott Hatfield;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/scott-hatfield

Task Dwarf;Turn your chores into epic quests;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v94YcXZInw0;"Task Dwarf turns daily chores into quests. Players type what they want to do. An AI mentor converts the user's words into doable tasks. It then converts these tasks into quests. To simplify workflow, there's templates for common tasks (exercise, chores, pomodoros).

There's a micro story behind each tick, to motivate the player to keep going on. Once they tick everything, a success story pops up, and they are rewarded with a treasure.

There is no edit or delete task button, only a forfeit button. Players must commit to the quest! (there's a failure path too)

Gemini 1.5 Pro is used for:
- Conversations with the mentor
- Mentor turns vague sentences to simpler tasks
- More accurate task estimate by doing totals
- Better (and softer) safeguards

Gemini 1.5 Flash is used for:
- Converting boring checklists into epic quests
- Estimating each task
- Success path for each task
- Fail path for the whole quest (+ motivational talk)
- Generating treasures related to the quest

What the user doesn't initially know is that the system is the AI (this is where Gemini comes in) and it occasionally intercepts basic commands to discourage the user from exploring. The user can talk to the AI via the terminal, but the AI will remain cryptic and uncooperative until the user finds the password. The system contains logs hinting at what happened and puzzles which will lead to the password. After entering the password, the AI will reply to any questions directly and tell the user its story.

this concept is important in both paper books and E-books. And second level ƒ?? full text

On the Android side it uses MediaPipe's object detection to detect the cats paws either by consuming the camera feed or from a selected image.

Once we have a picture of the paw (toebeans) the user can then get different fortunes for their cat. On Android it uses VertexAI and Gemini to generate the response from the given fortune prompt. On iOS it uses Firebase Functions to call the Gemini API. This is done because currently the VertexAI package for iOS is written in swift and not compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform. Toebeans also uses Firebase Remote Config to be able to adjust the prompt parameters and model settings remotely. As well as Firebase Auth for user authentication (currently disabled).

The user is also able to ""modify"" their original fortune response to a different type. The app then takes the original response and tells Gemini to rewrite it in a different style.

Traffic_Complaint_System;;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9w2EwYGDso;"Basic idea of my project was to ease the process of complaining traffic violation in my country, as you maybe aware that most of the streets and cities in bangladesh doesn't have enough traffic police or traffic lights, and you see a vehicle committing crime, violating traffic rules you can't even complaint except reaching out to the nearest police station or police box. Now what I've implemented is that you take pictures of the vehicle, take note of the vehicle number and submit an online application from your phone or any device able to access the web. Where gemini api is being used?
Well there is two methods for submitting a complaint, one you write out manually, provide images and fill all the details, then submit.
Another, you just need to upload the vehicle violation image, if vehicle number and location is not identified from the given image, you can submit them just like a normal chat with your friend or provide another image containing vehicle number or with more information of the violation that the vehicle is making.
Gemini is playing a key role here to ease the process of complaining just by using a mere picture. Now it has a huge future scope, for example we can implement a live monitoring system using camera on the street for violation and complaint or fine the vehicle owner by using vehicle number automatically just like Dubai.

Work Buildup;Fast Planning and real-time Tracking;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qTFaPuQf0s;"No plan survives contact with reality.
The only benefit of planning lies in the forward-thinking process itself. However, a plan's usefulness diminishes rapidly if it remains unchanged. To maintain its value, a plan must continuously evolve in response to new information and changing circumstances. Plans have to be thoughtfully complete, yet need to be constantly adaptive to be of the most use.
WorkBuildup is an approachable project planning tool to:
- quickly decompose complex project work into smaller, more bite size tasks, as well as quickly articulate realistic expectations based on current knowledge of a project,
- encourage constant iterative planning and project tracking through extremely easy viewing and updating, and highlight the consequences of changes to the work plan as new information is discovered. - provide immediate visual feedback on progress and potential hotspots in the work.
- for those who are on the front line, as well as all those in between, the work breakdown structure provides context so there is a better understanding of the ""why"" behind the work.
Google Gemini powers the WorkBuildup task generation process by aiding, in a careful human-in-the-loop way, the breakdown of work into detailed steps at each level. This dramatically accelerates the planning process and allows users to very quickly craft the details of work, sometimes even capturing work that wasn't previously considered or was outside the mind-frame of the user.

Wunderous;re-Imagining generative AI as social platform for humans;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB6m-kjajok;"Wunderous explores an idea related to multi-agent AI conversations, but in different direction: connecting multiple humans through a single Gemini instance that acts as a mediator among them e.g. consider this chat:
- Houman: Can you tell Sara that I said Hi?
- Gemini: Sure, I will let Sara know.
(later)
- Sara: Any news since we last interacted?
- Gemini: Yes, Houman said Hi!
Wunderous relies on system instructions to help Gemini generate cohesive dialogues, e.g. to avoid an invalid dialogue such as
- Houman: Can you tell Sara that I said Hi?
- Gemini: Sure Houman! Hey Sara, Houman is saying Hi!
(This is invalid because, from Houman's perspective, it's not addressing him, and also because Sara might not be interacting with Wunderous until much later.)
Just as a proof of concept, instructions for interactive stories and textcasting with an audience are included, but the core objective is to provide a toolset for experimenting with various instructions and setups for multi-user generative conversations e.g. a moderated debate room, a journalism channel, etc. The toolset, in particular, includes real-time chat via Firebase. I chose Gemini Flash for content generation as Gemini Pro can be costly in a long chat with a large token count. However, Gemini Pro is still used in the 'Interaction Validator' to validate individual user prompt and Flash response pairs, providing JSON schema-based 'corrective instructions' for Flash to retry whenever the pair is evaluated as invalid.";Flutter, Firebase, Gemini, of course :);Wundersmiths;Canada;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/wunderous

This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, making it difficult to systematically gather and analyze relevant information.
Yapper automates the extraction and organization of data from scientific literature, with an initial focus on plant sciences, compounds, and their roles in human health. Powered by the Gemini API, Yapper allows researchers to effortlessly search, filter, and sort through critical information.
How It Works:
* We scrape abstract data from sources like Nature and PubMed.
* Using Gemini's gemini-1.5-flash-latest model, we extract plant names, compound names, and their roles from the abstracts.
* A self-validation loop, also powered by Gemini, ensures the accuracy of the extracted data, cross-referencing it against the original abstracts.
* Data that passes the validation loop is stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore. Algolia automaticaly indexed new entry in the database,
* The frontend, hosted on Vercel, presents the final, validated data to the user.
Yapper is designed to streamline the research process, reducing the effort required to analyze scientific papers and accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;Yapper;Indonesia;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/yapper

Yield Smart;YOUR FIELD IN PALM OF YOUR HAND;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD2FErGhSq8;"Yield Smart is an innovative app designed to revolutionize plant care and farming by leveraging the power of AI, IoT, and real-time data. The app serves two primary segments: urban dwellers and farmers. For urban users, Yield Smart allows plants to communicate their needs through real-time sensor data, providing insights on factors like sunlight, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall. Users can interact with their plants via text or voice, making plant care engaging and accessible. For farmers, Yield Smart offers an advanced field monitoring system, using AI and OpenCV to scan, grid, and analyse large fields, providing valuable insights for crop management and yield improvement.

Firebase plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, updating sensor data in real-time and facilitating seamless communication between users and the Gemini LLM. After a userƒ??s voice input is recorded and converted to text, it is sent to Firebase, where the Gemini API processes the query and generates natural language responses. These responses are then sent back to Firebase, fetched by the microcontroller, and converted to speech for the user. This setup ensures efficient, real-time interaction, making the user experience intuitive and smooth. Additionally, Geminiƒ??s capabilities are integrated into the Yield Smart web app, where users can upload images of their plants for diagnosis and receive AI-powered recommendations and advice, further enhancing the plant care and farming experience.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;Tech Innovators;India;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/yield-smart

Zwisch organizes carpools within school communities, where trust and safety are key. Students can request a ride with a simple sentence.

Simply type a sentence or two about your ride details. Gemini analyzes your text and matches you with a rider/driver if possible.

The Gemini 1.5 Pro API converts natural language inputs and creates JSON ride objects. Whenever a new request or offer is created, Gemini processes all unfulfilled requests and offers at once, then matches them based on compatibility of route similarity, timing, and your preferences. A ride is created on Firebase Firestore, and notifications are sent to both users.

Zwisch was started by two friends, Alessio Toniolo and Vedic Patel who were tired of campus traffic congestion and a lack of easy-to-use apps. Alessio (18) is a senior at Marist School and Vedic (18) is a senior at South Forsyth High School. Their home of Atlanta is notorious for traffic plus a lack of accessible public transportation. The carpooling solution, Zwisch, was designed to scale for schools, colleges, and even workplaces to mitigate bad traffic and mitigate the climate crisis.";Web/Chrome, Firebase;Alessio Toniolo and Vedic Patel;United States;https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/zwisch

As people we tend to capture photos or bookmark sites or note down an address quickly in a notes application for later retrieval, but as time passes on we find it tough to retrieve it back. Stowboard solves this by automatically analysing the content you store and tags them so that you can perform searches like - get me the addresses that i saved or get me the photos of the cutlery i took or get me the wallet website i saved making it much for easier for the user to locate their content instead of endlessly sifting through multiple apps. When storing images the app makes use of Gemini's vision capability to identify objects within the image to create tags and summary. With links the app extracts the title, keywords and description and feeds it to the text generation capability of Gemini to create tags and summary. With text the app uses Gemini to categorise the text into address, mobile number, notes or reminders and creates a tag and summary from this. The tags and summary generated by Gemini is then converted to vector using Gemini's embedding capabilities and is stored in Redis.

2- What ""GemAds"" does: AI-Driven Ad Creator helps the user to generate full ads using Gemini API and also offer the ability to download the generated ads as html to use it for any purpose he needs
-How ""GemAds"" use Gemini API: it sends the user input and a specially engineered prompt to make Gemini API respond in json format which includes everything related to the ad like text, animations, colors, positioning of everything and many more things (some of them already made in my code like animations so Gemini job is to choose what suites the Ad).

3- What ""GemAds+"" does: same as GemAds but gives the user and Gemini more freedom.
-How ""GemAds"" use Gemini API: same as GemAd but implemented differently which makes it make a different style of Ads some of these new features: Gemini can color, rotate,and make patterns using the pngs chosen by the user and it can make and control multiple text lines and png objects in different dimensions.";I primarily used HTML (including JS, CSS) for the user interface of my tools.

The user will first query the chatbot and then review the causal variables stemming from this event. The chatbot will respond with 3causes and 3 effects. This enables personal discovery and analysis through causal inferencing.

If the user wants to dive into a particular area, we provide 6 other experts to re-query their request. These 6 experts are also Zero-shot prompts. The 6 experts are Local, Municipal, National, Global, Economical and Ecological. Each prompt has a different lens and language type. For example, the local expert will respond with language befitting a friend while the global expert will respond with language befitting a president.

In terms of the Gemini API, I primarily used the chat-session and google ai Studio.
